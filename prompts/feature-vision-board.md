We need a vision board for the user.

The vision board will display a grid of images. We will show a 3-columns grid on desktop and a 1-column grid on mobile.

If there is no picture, we will display a "No images on vision board" message.

The user can click on an image to see a larger version of the image in a modal.

From the table of images / prompts, the user can select an image and add it to the vision board.

The prompt table will have a "Add to Vision Board" button for each image.

If an image is added to the vision board, the button will change to a "Remove from Vision Board" button.

The vision board will be stored in the database and retrieved from the database.

The vision board will be a separate page.

Items on the vision board will be draggable.

The vision board will have a "delete" button for each image.

The "delete" button will be an "X" with a line around it, background is transparent.

We will also need an app header bar with the app title and a "Vision Board" link that takes the user to the vision board page.
