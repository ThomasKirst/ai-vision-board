We need a vision board for the user.

The vision board will display a grid of images.

The user can click on an image to see a larger version of the image in a modal.

From the table of images / prompts, the user can select an image and add it to the vision board.

The vision board will be stored in the database and retrieved from the database.

The vision board will be a separate page.
