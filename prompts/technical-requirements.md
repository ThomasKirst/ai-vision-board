Technical requirements:

We will use Next.js as the framework.

We use the App Router.

Make use of React Server Components. Avoid using fetch in useEffect hooks. Avoid api routes if possible. Data should be fetched on the server.

Server actions should be kept in a separate file if they form a logical unit.

We will use shadcn for the UI.

We will use SQLite for the database.

We donÂ´t use any ORM. No Drizzle, Shizzle, or Prisma.

Make sure to add all node package dependencies and shadcn components. Provide the bash commands to install the dependencies and the components.
